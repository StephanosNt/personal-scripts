# Personal Scripts & Projects 🛠️  

Welcome to my personal repository! This is where I store various scripts and projects, including those with **errors and unfinished features** for learning and practice.

## 📌 About  
This repository serves as my **practice ground** for coding, debugging, and improving my programming skills. 
Some scripts may work perfectly, while others contain **intentional or accidental bugs** that I use to test and learn debugging.  
Sometimes it’s a small script to test an idea, sometimes a project that I’m working on. 
There’s no real order or goal—just random, fun experiments and practice along the way!

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
These projects are mostly just random ideas.
Some may not work as expected (that’s part of the learning process!).
Feel free to play with the code, but don’t expect it to always be polished!
